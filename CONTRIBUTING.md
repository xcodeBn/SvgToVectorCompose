## Getting Started

Before you begin contributing, please:

1. Read this contributing guide thoroughly
2. Check the [existing issues](https://github.com/xcodebn/SvgToVectorCompose/issues) to see if your idea or bug report already exists
3. Fork the repository and clone it locally
4. Set up your development environment

## Development Setup

1. **Clone your fork:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/SvgToVectorCompose.git
   cd SvgToVectorCompose
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash

   ```

4. **Test the installation:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --help
   ```

## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes** - Fix issues with SVG parsing, Kotlin generation, or CLI functionality
- **Feature enhancements** - Add new SVG element support, improve IconPack generation, etc.
- **Documentation** - Improve README, add examples, create tutorials
- **Performance improvements** - Optimize conversion speed, memory usage
- **Code quality** - Refactor code, add type hints, improve error handling

### Before You Start

- **For bug fixes**: Create an issue describing the bug unless one already exists
- **For new features**: Open an issue to discuss the feature before implementing
- **For documentation**: Small improvements can be made directly; for major changes, please discuss first

## Code Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) style guidelines
- Use type hints where possible
- Write descriptive variable and function names
- Add docstrings for classes and functions
- Keep functions focused and small

### Example Code Style

```python
def parse_svg_element(element: ET.Element, parent_transform: str = "") -> Optional[PathData]:
    """
    Parse an SVG element and convert it to PathData.
    
    Args:
        element: The XML element to parse
        parent_transform: Transform from parent elements
        
    Returns:
        PathData object or None if parsing fails
    """
    if element.tag.endswith('path'):
        return self._parse_path_element(element, parent_transform)
    elif element.tag.endswith('polygon'):
        return self._parse_polygon_element(element, parent_transform)
    return None
```

### Kotlin Code Generation

- Generated Kotlin code should follow Kotlin conventions
- Use PascalCase for ImageVector names
- Ensure proper package structure
- Maintain consistent formatting

## Testing

### Manual Testing

Since we don't have automated tests yet, please test your changes manually:

1. **Test with simple SVGs:**
   ```bash
   python main.py -i test_icons -o test_output -p com.test.icons --generate-index
   ```

2. **Test with complex SVGs (if available):**
   - Test with IntelliJ icons or Material Design icons
   - Verify conversion success rate

3. **Test CLI functionality:**
   - Test all command-line options
   - Test interactive mode
   - Test configuration file loading

4. **Test edge cases:**
   - Empty directories
   - Invalid SVG files
   - Special characters in filenames
   - Nested directory structures

### Adding Tests

We welcome contributions that add proper testing infrastructure:

- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for full conversion process
- Test fixtures with known SVG files
- Automated testing setup
